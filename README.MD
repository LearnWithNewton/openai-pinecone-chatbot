# OpenAI-Pinecone Chatbot ü§ñ

Welcome to the OpenAI-Pinecone Chatbot project! This application leverages the power of OpenAI's language models and Pinecone's vector database to create an intelligent and responsive chatbot. The chatbot is designed to handle various queries by utilizing advanced natural language processing and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.

Embeddings and vector databases allow developers to create tools that can retrieve knowledge from custom documents and use it to form more accurate and dynamic conversations. But while cutting-edge AI models like ChatGPT can generate useful conversational responses to many different kinds of queries, the replies are always limited to the data that was available when the model was last trained. In this course, instructor Guil Hernandez offers an overview of text embeddings, vector databases, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to elevate and optimize your AI learning journey. Along the way, test out your new skills in the exercise challenges provided at the end of each section.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to understand and generate human-like text.
- **Vector Database**: Employs Pinecone for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Vite and Webpack for a fast and scalable development experience.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses dotenv for managing environment variables securely.
